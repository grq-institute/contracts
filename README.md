# Project Security Announcement

Dear Community,

While our project launch has been postponed, we are committed to transparency and security. We are making our smart contract code and audit report available for community review before deployment.

## Pre-Launch Security Resources

- **Smart Contract Code**: Available for review in our repository
- **Preliminary Audit Report**: Conducted by QuillAudits (final report pending contract deployment)

## Important Security Notes

- The audit report is currently in preliminary form and will be updated with the deployed contract address once the GenesisRewardPool contract is deployed to Berachain mainnet
- The final audit report will be published in the QuillAudits repository at: https://github.com/Quillhash/QuillAudit_Reports

## Security Verification

We strongly encourage all community members to:
1. Review the provided code before interacting with the protocol
2. Verify that the deployed contract matches the audited code when deployment occurs
3. Wait for our comprehensive security overview (including multisig details, ownership structure, and additional security measures) which will be shared once pre-deposits are live

We believe this proactive approach to security serves the community's best interests and demonstrates our commitment to building a secure and trustworthy protocol.

Thank you for your patience and support.

The Team
